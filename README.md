I'm Jay and I'm a software engineer who graduated from SJSU with a degree in Computer Science. I have previously worked in Healthcare IT and have recently graudated from App Academy to further my skills in web development. I am most proficient in Javascript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, with some experience in MERN stack (Mongodb, ExpressJS, React, Node.)

I've create an Airbnb clone that has user auth, hostings creation, and location search functionalities in less than two weeks which you can see (here)[https://airjnj.herokuapp.com/].
